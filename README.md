To create a simple Rust web app on macOS, you can use the Rocket web framework. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install Rust: If you haven't already, install Rust by following the instructions on the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Create a New Rust Project: Open your terminal and create a new Rust project by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
cargo new my_web_app --bin
This command creates a new directory called my_web_app with a Cargo.toml file and a src directory containing a main.rs file.
Add Rocket to Cargo.toml: Open Cargo.toml in your project directory and add the following lines to the [dependencies] section:
toml
Copy code
[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.1"
Edit src/main.rs: Replace the contents of src/main.rs with the following code:
rust
Copy code
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![index])
}
Build and Run the App: In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to build and run your web app:
bash
Copy code
cargo run
Access Your Web App: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You should see the message "Hello, world!" displayed.
That's it! You've created a simple Rust web app using the Rocket framework on macOS.
